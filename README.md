Why foodiesUnite? Currently everyone is trying to find a way to cut costs, and save money to continue living during these uncertain times. What better place to start than your own kitchen? We wanted to create an app that helped us achieve a certain goal, whether you're just looking to maintain, lose some pounds, or even if you're trying to get jacked like Mr. Bean, we have something you'll like. By inputting your information (age, sex, height & weight) we'll be able to give you different meal options based on your desired goal. Gone are the days of wondering whether butter is a carb, and we'll always be here to reassure you that there has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.

## Purpose

As stated in our hook, the goal of foodiesUnite is to assist the world in finally deciding on what to eat! Whether you're after that summer bod, looking to upgrade your culinary expertise, or simply looking for an idea for your next meal, you've come to the right place. Go ahead and navigate your beautiful self to our 'Deployed Site:' section and see what all the fuss is about!

## Functionality

Through collaborative & synchronized efforts, we've seamlessly integrated one client-side API (Materialize) and two server-side APIs (Edamam & RapidAPI Fitness Calculator) to bring to you a meal generating webpage that suggests meals based on individually inputted user bio-metrics. Below is a sample output:

## Future Changes: 

Through designing and building this web application, our lack of health & nutrition expertise became apparent and we've learned a lot of valuable insight. We plan on implementing more input fields for users to provide additional information which we've found to be critical in calculating a more precise BMI. In tandem, we plan on reworking the JavaScript functionality to harness & process this information. Naturally we'll continue to update the aesthetic as we revisit this project with fresher sets of eyes. For now, we hope you enjoy!
